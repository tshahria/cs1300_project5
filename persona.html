      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p class="lead">Originally, my friends and I decided to buy the instant pot on a whim. We thought it would be a magic device that would let college students enjoy fine cuisine on a regular basis easily 
        Oh how wrong I was. Between reading the very condensed manual and googling instructions, this instant pot was anything but easy to use. I thought that it couldn't just be me. This HAS to be hard for everyone.
      </p>
        
      <p class="lead">So, I decided to observe 3 of my friends interact with the Instant Pot I own.</p>

        <li class="list-group-item">
          Observation 1
          <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">Found it hard to figure out how to start the cooker so he Googled to find tutorials </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Had to google to see how to depressurize the cooker at the end</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Took a while to figure out what button to press. Initially kept pressing random buttons to start but ended up just reading the manual to figure it out.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Still preferred to use this to make food (rice and pork) over the stovetop</li>
          </ul>
          Summary <br>
          <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item"> Found the overall experience somewhat mediocre and harder to use than expected. He felt a lot of the buttons were placed somewhat arbitrarily, but was able to figure out how to use it in the end after reading the manual and watching videos.

              By the end he was able to accomplish his goal, but the main challenges he faced were figuring out the knob setup for the vent, and the correct button to press. 
    
              He said even with prior extensive cooking experience, he found it hard to use, but still recommended this purchase for people with lack of kitchen space.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Observation 2
          <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">Trouble choosing what button to press so he read manual</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Had to google to see how to depressurize the cooker at the end</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Was somewhat rushed while using the cooker as he was doing it between classes</li>
          </ul>
          Summary <br>
          <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item"> Felt there was a steep learning curve to using the cooker, but easy once you figured it out, and it matched their expectations of the rice cooker. They said they found the rice cooker’s UI to be solid given how much it had to do given the tiny space, and that it can’t be improved a lot. 

              They were able to cook their food in time even though it was somewhat rushed, but couldn’t figure out easily how to vent the cooker and what button to press. They said they somewhat expected difficulty given their lack of cooking experience, but they were able to cook food so they were happy with it. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Observation 3
          <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">Started by reading the manual, so I knew most of how to use the instant pot.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Had issues figuring out if the vent was closed or how to close the lid. Also spent some time figuring out what button to click.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Had trouble in the end venting the cooker prior to opening.</li>
          </ul>
          Summary <br>
          <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item"> Found the usage of instant pot self explanatory but thought it was hard to figure out what option to use on the cooker. Also had difficulties figuring out if the lid was closed. Felt the interface was very nice and appreciated that the buttons were labeled.

              He said he had no prior cooking experience, but was able to easily cook his eggs in a reasonable amount of time. Overall found it easier to use than expected.</li>

          <li class="list-group-item">Doesn't read the manual. Tries to use it straight out of the box and was left very confused by all the buttons, and how to start the cooker. Had to google to figure out a lot of the functions and was very rushed due to homework/classwork.
          <li class="list-group-item">A lot of users for this cooker will most likely be college students with limited time, as it is very hands off and does a lot of the work for you.

          <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">Faced trouble figuring out how all the buttons worked, but read the manual. Even after reading the manual, they still had some confusion regarding some specific functions (i.e how to depressurize the cooker)
            
              Because it is new technology, spends a lot of time analyzing and learning from the manual prior to actually using the cooker.
              
            <li class="list-group-item">A lot of users for this device will most likely be users who want an all in one device for their kitchen, and older people do tend to cook more so would most likely purchase this product.
