                <p class="lead"> The goal of the application is to allow the user to purchase clothes while filtering by region it was made, and the size of the clothing. The user can also sort by name or by price.</p>
                <p class="lead">The user can add to cart which will show on the right side of the screen, along with quantity of that item, price of that item and the total price.
                    The user can also choose to add/remove by either clicking on the button on the item itself, or he/she can just remove all of the specific item from the cart by clicking the trashcan logo in the cart.

                            The website is very easy to learn as its very minimalistic and lacks a lot of clutter. Thus the user should be able to easily understand how to use it.

                                <li class="list-group-item"> The trash can logo on the cart item implies removing it from the cart</li>
